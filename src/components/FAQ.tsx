      question: "Where does my contribution go?",
      answer: "It funds designing, building tools, and holding community sessions; it's the fuel behind the progress."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I get for ₹69.99?",
      answer: "You get a 15-minute live segment during a Twitch stream to share your idea, project, or creative process. It's a one-time feature, and slots are first come, first served."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this just for students?",
      answer: "No. Builders, dreamers, coders, artists. Everyone is welcome."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I join the community?",
      answer: "Links are provided in the bio, NavBar (top), footer (bottom), or type !discord or !community during a stream to get in."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I share my project idea here?",
      answer: "Yes! That’s exactly what the ₹69.99 live slot is for. Whether you have a rough concept or a work-in-progress, you're welcome to present it."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this a mentorship platform?",
      answer: "Not officially. It’s more of a collaborative build space, sometimes with guest experts, but mostly peer-led and community-driven."
    },
    {
      question: "When will the actual platform launch?",
      answer: "It’s being built in public. Beta access to the frontend will roll out soon, especially for early community members."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my feedback be used?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Feedback helps shape the direction of the platform. Anonymous suggestions are welcome too."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a cost to join the platform?",
      answer: "No. The platform and Discord are free. Contributions are totally optional and go toward supporting development."
    },
    {
      question: "I'm not ready to share yet. Can I still be part?",
      answer: "Yes. You can lurk, learn, and jump in when you're ready. There's zero pressure to present anything."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between the ₹69.99 and ₹99.99 options?",
      answer: "₹69.99 is a one-time 15-minute stream slot. ₹99.99 is a full-month pass: you get that same 15-minute feature in Week 1, plus 5-minute check-ins in Weeks 2–4 to update your journey."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the ₹99.99 monthly pass work exactly?",
      answer: "It's a 4-week spotlight cycle:\n\nWeek 1: 15-minute deep-dive into your idea or project\n\nWeeks 2–4: 5-minute weekly check-ins to show progress, pivots, or updates\nYou’ll also receive a clean recording of your first appearance and have a chance to earn from stream donations."
    },
    {
      question: "What do I use the weekly check-ins for?",
      answer: "To keep momentum. Each 5-minute segment is your space to share progress, wins, problems, or changes — whatever’s relevant to your build journey."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I earn through the stream with the ₹99.99 plan?",
      answer: "Yes. If your segment hits with viewers and they donate during your spotlight, you’ll receive a portion of those earnings."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I switch from ₹69.99 to ₹99.99 later?",
      answer: "If slots are still open for the month, yes; you can upgrade by paying the difference. Just reach out and we’ll sort it."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I get a recording of my live appearance?",
      answer: "Yes, if you’re on the ₹99.99 plan. You’ll receive a clean video file of your 15-minute stream segment to use however you want."
